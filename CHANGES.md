- **c)** cause the modified Documentation to carry a new Documentation Location notice if the original Documentation provided for one;
- **d)** make available the modified Documentation at the same level of abstraction as that of the Documentation, in the preferred format for making modifications to it (e.g. the native format of the CAD tool as applicable), and in the event that format is proprietary, in a format viewable with a tool licensed under an OSI-approved license if the proprietary tool can create it; and
- **e)** license the modified Documentation under the terms and conditions of this Licence or, where applicable, a later version of this Licence as may be issued by CERN.
